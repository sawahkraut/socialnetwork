# Socialnetwork

Spiced Academy: Social Network Project

I built a socialnetwork to study React, Socket.io and Redux.
This socialnetwork includes the following features: bio editor, profile picture upload, a chatroom, user search, a friend request/cancel/accept/pending button, and a delete profile option.

This project was built solely for educational purposes. The idea behind it was to build an anime-fan based network, so that people who are new to a city can connect with other anime-lovers near-by.

Technologies/packages used: socket.io, redux, postgres, express, node, AWS, react.
